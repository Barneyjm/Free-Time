GPS Mod v. Irritated Koala :


how to install:

back up your game first! (at least your player.config and 
assets folder)

paste the "assets" folder in your game folder, it should be
something like this :
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Starbound"
say "yes" when asked if you want to replace files.


the 'glitch' and 'treasure' folders are included if you don't 
have an easy way to create items (such as a tech) in-game.
Simply create a new glitch character with the changes in 
the folder and you'll find the new tech in the second
ship locker.  

OTHERWISE, the gps tech name is just "gpstech" and the
other folders aren't needed. Create that
item however you would normally create an item.
